# CLI
This is a sample project for CLI which is implemented focusing on extensibility; that means for any command community wants to extend they can simply introduce their connector and plug it in.

# Plugins:
So far I have implemented the following npm scopped plugins:
- [@amir-cli/cli-get](@amir-cli/cli-get)
- [@amir-cli/cli-set](@amir-cli/cli-set)
- [@amir-cli/cli-init](@amir-cli/cli-init)

# Contribution form the community:
Please feel free to send pull requests to plugin your newly implemented connectors so the community can take advantege of it as well.
